There is no negative marking in our session.
Kindly don't hesitate to ask the question.

Python Programming:

What is Python?
1. Python is a programming langauge like other
langauge Java, PHP, C#, VC++.......

Programming Langauge: Target is to develop
the IT applications.

Python is more popular to make data driven 
applications.

Online and Offline:

Why Python:
1. Easy to understand, user friendly, more English
like language
2. Open source programming languages.
3. Interpreter based langauge. 
4. Python supports modular approach of programming.
5. Python is having 2 Lakhs+ libraries.
6. Python is used in versatile domains:
    a. Data Driven Domains: 
        DA, ML, DL, DS, AI, Gen AI, NLP, IP....
    b. Other domains:
        web development, mobile applications,
        IOT, Robotics, Cyber Security.....
7. Supports OOPS : Object Oriented Programming.
8. Dynamic Data Type Definition.
9. Dynamic Memory Allocation.
10. Python is having a big community.
11. There are many more reasons to go with Python,
once you will dive deep into python, you will find
many more reasons.

.Net: Microsoft.

OOPS support: Bigger applications can be developed
with reduced complexity.
Compiler based: Firstly complete program is 
compiled, it will be checked if there are some
 errors in the program then program won't execute.
 If no error then program will execute.
Interpreter based: Program is executed line by line.

C, C++, Java....Compiler based

Testing Team: 

Debugging: Errors check line by line.

Modular approach: We divide our program into 
multiple small modules and then interface these
modules together.

APIs.

API based approach: Application Programming Interface.
Mobile Application: 
80% web developer, 20% mobile app developer.

I am going to teach from the scratch: 
Class room students are from different background.



Variables: are containers to store data, whose value
varies in the program.

How to make variables in python: 
Option 1: By assigning the value
x=5     
x=7
y=9

How to make variables in C Lang:
int a,b;    #Data type definition compulsory
a=5;
b=7;
a=9;

Data Types: Like in real life, we can differentiate
different types of data like whole numbers, decimal
point numbers, text data, complex numbers etc,
similarly in programming to differentiate different
types of data, we have data types.

There are 2 broad categories of predefined core
data types:
Please remember, we are talking about different
types of values. 
Single Element: Non Iterators
int         25,78,-190
float       2.35, 4.0, -9.7
complex     2+3j
bool        True, False
NoneType    None

Multi Element: Iterators
str         Collection of characters. Single, double or triple quotes
list        Collection of heterogeneous data type. [2,99.5,True,"CETPA"]
tuple
dict
set
frozenset
"""
# #New Program
# x=5     #int
# x=2.5   #float
# x=2+5j  #complex
# x="CETPA"   #string


"""
x=123   #Non iterator
x="123" #Iterator

In Python, we can pass functions inside functions.
Firstly inner function executes then outer function.

"""
# #New Program
# print("CETPA")
# print(len("CETPA"))     #print(5)

# #New Program
# x=5     #int
# print(type(x))

# #New Program
# x="5"       #str
# print(x,type(x))
# x=5         #int
# print(x,type(x))

"""
Syntax to call a function:
function_name(comma separated arguments)

len function only works on iterators (multi elements)

Data expansion: Insights, forcasting, recommendation. 

Data is called the new oil of the industry.

Practice is must to learn python.

IDE's used in Python: Integrated Development
Environment: Software used to develop applications
1. PyCharm: Web Development
2. VSCode: New: Used in versatile applications
3. Jupyter: Data driven
4. Spyder: Data Driven 
5. Google Colab: Online Data driven:

Aayush: B. Tech: GNIOT: Final year

PyCharm: 
How to install:
1. Google: Search Python Download: First link:
open: download python latest version: install next next
interpreter

2. Google: Search PyCharm Download: First Link:
open: pycharm download:
next, next, near the end, it will ask
environment variables: tick, yes. next, next

B. Tech: In every semester exams, they think, that
from next semester, I will start learning from
day 1 only.

In case, you miss any class, then please leave

"""

# #New Program

# print(len(x))       #error

# print(len(x))

"""
Dynamic Data Type Definition: Data type is defined
at the run time in python.

Dynamic Memory Allocation: Whenever we pass new
values to variables in python, these are stored
at new addresses.

Variables: RAM: Volatile memory: The moment, program
is stopped, all variables will be destroyed. 

C Lang:
int a;  #Memory fixed, say a is representing 1000 location
a=5;    #5 will be stored at 1000
a=7;    #7 will be stored at 1000

Python:
a=5     #int, say 1000 location
a="CETPA"   #str    say 2000 location
a=2.5       #float  say 3000 location 
a=9000000000000000000000000000000000    #4000 location.

Comments in Python: Comments make our program
readable. comments are not executed in the program

How to use comments:
1. using # character: cntrl + /: comment/uncomment
2. by mentioning in string.

Kasam No 1: Oath no 1: Always try to use max possible
comments in the program. Min one comment: purpose
of the program/module/part of the code

Comments are called the first coding standard
of programming.

Coding standards: complexity reduce, code readable,
code scalable.
